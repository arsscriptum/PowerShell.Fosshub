# PowerShell.Fosshub 

A PowerShell Script to download the ```iview460_x64_setup``` file and the ```iview460_plugins_x64_setup``` file.

The **IRFANVIEW 64** program is a super cool image viewer that I install on all my machines. Unfortunately, they tried to make sure
that everyone downloads the installers via the website manually, without automation. I created that script to bypass their check and automate the download.

## How to use

```powerwhell
  . .\Get-FosshubFile.ps1
```
